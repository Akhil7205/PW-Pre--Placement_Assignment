    Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?
    Ans:
    
 Synchronous and asynchronous are two different modes of execution in programming that determine
 how tasks oroperations are handled.

Synchronous Execution:
In synchronous execution, tasks are performed one after another in a sequential manner.
Each task must complete before the next one can start. The program waits for each task to finish
before moving on to the next task. This means that the execution flow is blocked until a particular
 task is completed.


console.log('Task 1');
console.log('Task 2');
console.log('Task 3');
In the above example, Task 1 is executed first, followed by Task 2, and then Task 3.
 The program will not proceed to the next line until the previous line has finished executing.

Asynchronous Execution:
In asynchronous execution, tasks are initiated but don't necessarily complete immediately.
Instead of waiting for a task to finish before moving on, the program can continue executing
other tasks concurrently or wait for the completion of tasks without blocking the execution flow
Asynchronous operations often involve callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.
tion:

console.log('Task 1');
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Task 2');
}, 2000);
console.log('Task 3');
In the above example, Task 1 is executed first, then the setTimeout function is called to schedule
Task 2 to run after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). While waiting for the timeout,
Task 3 is executed immediately. After the specified delay, Task 2 is executed asynchronously.

Asynchronous execution is particularly useful when performing tasks that may take some time to complete, 
such as making API requests, reading files, or handling user input. It allows the program to continue 
running and be responsive while waiting for time-consuming operations to finish. Asynchronous programming
can improve the overall performance and responsiveness of applications.

     Q.2 What are Web Apis ?
    Ans:
    An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, data structures,
     object classes and protocols provided by libraries and operating systems to support the building of applications. 

    It's a software interface that serves as a link between two programs, allowing them to interact.
     It allows web servers to easily and quickly interact with various third-party applications and services.

    Web APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are a set of rules and protocols that allow 
    different software applications to communicate with each other. They enable developers to access and
     interact with the functionality and data of other web services or applications.

    Web APIs are commonly used for retrieving data from a remote server, sending data to a server, 
    or performing specific actions on a server. They provide a standardized way for different systems 
    to exchange information and perform tasks

 Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?
 Ans:
 Both setTimeout and setInterval are built-in JavaScript functions that allow you to schedule 
 the execution of code at specified intervals. They are commonly used for creating timers,
  animations, and performing tasks periodically in web applications.

setTimeout:
The setTimeout function is used to execute a specified block of code once after a certain delay. 
It takes two arguments: a function to be executed and a delay time in milliseconds. After the 
specified delay, the provided function is executed.
Here's an example of using setTimeout:

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Delayed execution!');
}, 2000);
In the above example, the function console.log('Delayed execution!') will be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

setInterval:
The setInterval function is used to execute a specified block of code repeatedly at a fixed interval.
 It takes two arguments: a function to be executed and a delay time in milliseconds.
  The provided function will be executed repeatedly with the specified delay between each
   execution until it is canceled.
Here's an example of using setInterval:

let count = 0;
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Interval execution:', count);
  count++;
  if (count === 5) {
    clearInterval(intervalId); // Cancel the interval after 5 executions
  }
}, 1000);

  Q.4 how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?
  Ans:
  Certainly! Here's a simplified explanation of how to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript:

Asynchronous code refers to tasks that take some time to complete, such as fetching 
data from a server or reading a file. In JavaScript, you don't want these tasks to block
the execution of other code while waiting for them to finish. Instead, you want to handle 
them in a non-blocking way.

To handle asynchronous code, you can use techniques like callbacks, promises, async/await, 
event emitters, or reactive programming. Let's focus on the most commonly used approaches:

Callbacks: You can pass a function (callback) to an asynchronous operation. When the operation
completes, it calls the callback function, allowing you to handle the result or perform further
actions. Callbacks can create complex nested structures, making the code harder to read and maintain.

Promises: Promises provide a more structured approach. A promise represents the eventual completion
of an asynchronous operation and allows you to handle success or failure. You can chain multiple 
asynchronous operations together using the then method for success and the catch method for errors. 
Promises improve code readability and avoid callback hell.

Async/await: Async/await is a modern syntax built on top of promises. It allows you to write
asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to read and write.
You mark a function as async and use the await keyword to pause the execution until a promise is
resolved. This way, you can write code that appears to run sequentially, even though it's asynchronous
behind the scenes.

By using these techniques, you can ensure that your JavaScript code can handle asynchronous tasks
efficiently and without blocking the execution of other code. The choice between callbacks, promises,
or async/await depends on the JavaScript version you are using and the specific needs of your project.

Q.5 What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ?
Ans
Callbacks are functions in JavaScript that are passed as arguments to other functions and are 
invoked at a later point in time, often asynchronously. They allow you to specify code that should
 execute after a specific task or event completes. Callbacks are commonly used in scenarios
  such as handling asynchronous operations, event handling, and handling the response of an API call.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a situation that arises when working with
 multiple nested callbacks, resulting in code that becomes hard to read, understand, and maintain.
  It occurs when callbacks are nested within each other, leading to deeply indented and complex 
  code structures.


asyncOperation1(function(result1) {
    // Perform something with result1

    asyncOperation2(function(result2) {
        // Perform something with result2

        asyncOperation3(function(result3) {
            // Perform something with result3

            // More nested callbacks...
        });
    });
});


To mitigate the problem of callback hell, several techniques have been introduced in JavaScript,
 such as Promises, async/await, and the use of functional programming libraries like RxJS. 
 These techniques provide cleaner and more structured ways to handle asynchronous code and 
 void the issues associated with deeply nested callbacks.

    Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise
    Ans:
    Promises are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows you to work with asynchronous 
    operations. An asynchronous operation is a task that doesn't block the execution of other 
    code while it is being performed. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations 
    and their results in a more organized and readable manner.

  In JavaScript, a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an 
  asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise can be in one of three states:

  Pending: The initial state of a promise. It represents that the asynchronous operation is still 
  being processed and the final result is not available yet.
  
  Fulfilled: The promise is fulfilled when the asynchronous operation is completed successfully.
   It means that the requested data is available, and any associated handlers attached to the promise
    will be executed.

  Rejected: The promise is rejected when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails 
  to produce the desired result. It indicates that something went wrong, and the associated error
   will be passed to the rejection handler.

  To work with promises, JavaScript provides several methods to interact with them. Here are three commonly used methods:

  then(): The then() method is used to handle the fulfillment of a promise. It takes two optional
   callback functions as arguments: one for the fulfillment case and one for the rejection case. The then() method returns a new promise, allowing chaining of multiple asynchronous operations.

  asyncOperation()
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle successful fulfillment
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle rejection or error
    console.error(error);
  });
  catch(): The catch() method is used to handle the rejection of a promise. It is typically placed
   at the end of a promise chain to catch any errors that occur in the preceding then() methods. 
   It takes a callback function that handles the error.



  asyncOperation()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });

Q.7 Whatâ€™s async & await Keyword in JavaScript
 Ans:
The async and await keywords in JavaScript are used to simplify asynchronous code and make it 
appear more synchronous, improving readability and maintainability. 

The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. When a function is declared as async,
 it automatically returns a promise. The function can contain one or more await expressions, 
 which pause the execution of the function until the awaited promise is fulfilled or rejected.
  Inside an async function, you can write code that looks like synchronous code, but it behaves asynchronously.


async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous operation
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();

  // Code below the 'await' expressions will be executed once the promises are resolved
  console.log(data);
  return data;
}
In the above example, the fetchData function is declared as async, and it makes use of the await
 keyword to pause the execution until the fetch promise is fulfilled. The await keyword can be used with any promise-based operation.

By using async and await together, you can eliminate the need for explicit promise chaining using 
.then() and .catch(), which can often lead to callback hell. Instead, you can write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner.

To handle errors within an async function, you can use a try...catch block. If an error occurs 
during the execution of an await expression, the error will be caught by the catch block.


async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
Using async and await can greatly simplify working with asynchronous operations, making the 
code more concise and easier to understand compared to traditional promise-based or callback-based approaches.

  Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch Block & Why do we need it?
  Ans:
      The purpose of the try block is to enclose the section of code where an error might occur.
       It allows you to define a block of code that you want to monitor for exceptions.
        If an error occurs within the try block, the execution of the block is immediately stopped,
         and the control is passed to the nearest catch block.

      The purpose of the catch block is to define a section of code that will handle the 
      error or exception that occurred in the associated try block. It specifies what actions
       should be taken when a specific type of error occurs. The catch block takes an error object
        as a parameter, which can be used to access information about the error.

      
      try {
        // Code that might throw an error
        const result = someFunction();
        console.log(result);
      } catch (error) {
        // Code to handle the error
        console.error('An error occurred:', error);
      }
      In the above example, if an error occurs during the execution of someFunction(), 
      such as a function not being defined, it will throw an exception. The exception is then 
      caught by the catch block, and the specified error handling code will be executed.
      
      The try...catch block is useful for several reasons:
      
      Error handling: It allows you to handle errors in a controlled manner rather than letting 
      them propagate and potentially crashing the application. You can log the error, display an 
      error message to the user, or take appropriate actions to recover from the error.
      
      Graceful fallback: You can provide fallback logic or alternative code to be executed if
       an error occurs. This ensures that even if there's an error, your program can continue 
       running or provide a suitable response.
      
      Debugging: The catch block provides a convenient place to log or examine the error information,
       helping with debugging and identifying issues in the code.

    Q.9 Explain fetch
    Ans:
    In JavaScript, the fetch function is a built-in browser API that provides an easy way to 
    make asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve resources (such as JSON data, HTML, images, etc.) 
    from a network. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response of the request.

  The fetch function takes one mandatory argument: the URL from which you want to fetch the resource.
   It also accepts an optional second argument, an object, to specify additional options for the request, such as request headers, request method, body content, etc.

  The fetch function offers a powerful and flexible way to perform AJAX requests in JavaScript.
   It supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), allows you to set headers, 
   and handle different types of response data (JSON, text, blobs, etc.). It is widely used for
   making API calls and retrieving data from servers.

 Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?
  Ans:

  To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using the async and await keywords, you need 
  to prefix the function declaration with the async keyword. This allows you to use the await
   keyword inside the function to pause the execution until an asynchronous operation is completed.




async function functionName() {
  // Asynchronous operations using 'await'
  // ...
}

Here's an example of an asynchronous function that fetches data from an API using async/await:


async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
In the above example, the fetchData function is defined as an asynchronous function using the async
 keyword. Inside the function, the await keyword is used to pause the execution until the fetch
  promise is fulfilled and the response is received. Then, the response is parsed as JSON using 
  await response.json().

By using async and await together, you can write asynchronous code that appears more synchronous 
and sequential, making it easier to understand and maintain. The await keyword allows you to write
 code that waits for promises to resolve before moving on to the next line of code within the async function.

Remember that when using await, it must be inside an async function. Also, using await can only
 be done within the async function's execution context. If you want to use await outside of an 
 async function, you can wrap it in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) or 
 another asynchronous context.


(async () => {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  console.log(result);
})();
Using async and await can greatly simplify asynchronous programming in JavaScript by avoiding 
callback hell and allowing for more readable and maintainable code.
